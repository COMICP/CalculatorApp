# Overview

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the fundamental link between xaml forms and their C# controllers. 

This app is a simple calculator. It takes 2 user inputs in the form of strings. It then allows them to choose an operation that they wish to perform on their input. It then displays the result at the top of the screen. This contains no error correction and requires careful input to not break the program.  

I built this app to understand the view and controller functionality of Xamarin forms. In order to build an app with this framework, it is important to understand the relationship between the views and their respective controllers and what information can be transferred between them.
